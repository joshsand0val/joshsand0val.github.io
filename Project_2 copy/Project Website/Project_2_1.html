	<h1 class="firstbookheader">Crime and Punishment</h1>
	<h2 class="firstbookheader2">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h2>
	<p class="firstIndex">This book was a myriad of emotions, spaning from excitement, sorrow, grief, awe, and joy.
	The way the Dostoyevsky pulls the reader in with captivating characters like Raskolnikov, Marmeladov, Razumikhin, and 
	Zamyotov is done in such a way that gives them depth and life. The emotions spurred within the reader entices them to keep flipping the page.
	Initially, I picked up the book due to the fact that the book is considered one of the first existential novels written, but I kept reading because of the 
	psychological themes that permeate throughout the novel. In the first part, the main protagonist, Rodya as they call him, goes through something that 
	takes a very big toll on mind and throughout the novel Rodya has to endure through the implications of the act he has committed.

	<div class="secondbook">
	<h1 class="secondbookheader">The Stranger</h1>
	<h2 class="secondbookheader2">Albert Camus</h2>
	<p class="secondIndex">At first, this book had me vexed. It is the antithesis of sensibility, I thought. The opening line had my mouth ajar at the fact that
	 he was totally detached from what had just occurred not too long ago. My favorite scene was the second day he had off from work, reminded me of those days 
	 where you have nothing to do all day so you do nothing all day and it still seemed like a productive day. The narrative style of Camus is wonderous, it drags 
	 you across the page inasmuch as the plot does. After the climax, you'll have a swell time trying to come to his rationale. The ending will leave you at rest, 
	 you will come to realize there was some shred of salience is Meursault's semblance. Do keep in mind, this book is centered around the philosophy of Absurdism 
	 which is the conflict between human nature's tendency to try to find inherent meaning in life, and the inability to find any. The definition of Absurdism is 
	 the foreword of this book. Overall, I enjoyed this short read. This book is the literary equivalent of taking a train somewhere that you've never been to just 
	 to enjoy the views from the window before taking the next train back home and see the views from the other side of the train.

	<div class="thirdbook">
	<h1 class="thirdbookheader">The Republic</h1>
	<h2 class="thirdbookheader2">Plato</h2>
	<p class="thirdIndex">This book is one of the most influential books ever written and I now see why. Reading some of the paragraphs, I can truly see how this book has
	shaped Western Civilization. The main premise of the book is how should the perfect city should act. The book is constructed as a sort of dialogue between Socrates and his 
	pupils. He tries to instill to his pupils that a just society must have just citizens and vice versa. The society and citizen have a symbiotic relationship. The citizen must 
	contribute to their society and the society must give to the citizen, both must be done in order to maintain social cohesion. Some points in the book are a little "outdated".
	For example, Plato does have points on women and their role in society which is a little archaic but somewhat understandable considering this book was written more than 3000 
	years ago. A great take I took from the idea of the Theory of Forms. It is a philosophical world view that says that everything physical is not as true as its Form, or the essence 
	of what it represents. I highly recommend looking up the Allegory of the Cave where he likens this idea in greater clarity. He talks of a group of people in a cave that only see shadows. 
	They think theses shadows are reality and are true since they have only seen these shadows since birth. One person gets freed from his shackles and leaves the cave. Once he leaves he notices things like trees and the sun. 
	He goes back to try to free the others yet notices he can't see the shadows anymore, he can't register them anymore. The other people in the cave think he's crazy because all they've ever known were the shadows. Overall, an amazing 
	book that I highly recommend as an introduction to philosophy.
