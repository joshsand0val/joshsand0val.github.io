	<p class="firstp">I started out in New York, my mother would tell me every day to go to the local library after school
	where she would go after work to pick me up because she couldn't afford daycare, that's where my fascination for books began.
	After receiving my B.A. in English Literature, I decided to start up this site so I could have a place where I can let my 
	love for books flourish.
